# 0x02. Python - import & modules
This directory contains source code files and scripts (bash and Python scripts) on modules and import statements in Python. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Modules
* Import statements
* Namespaces
* Command line arguments (the `sys` module)

## How to run
Python script files contains the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain `#!/usr/bin/bash` followed by any of these:
* `python3 $PYFILE` where `$PYFILE` is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
* `python3 $PYCODE` where `$PYCODE` is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted
