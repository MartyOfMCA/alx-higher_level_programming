# CPython implementation of Python3 with all the default options
Having the following statements:

`1. print("I")`
`2. print("Love")`
`3. print("Python")`

## Question
Before the execution of `2. (print("Love"))`, how many int objects have been created and are still in memory?

## Simple Answer
The simple answer is 262! Yeah that's right!!! 262 ğŸ˜• (I know how confused you are right now)

## Detailed answer
Thanks for sticking around to this dreaded section! So here we go.

CPython has allocated a range of integer numbers to be used whenever an int variable is assigned to an object. 

The minimum number in the range is -5 and the maximum number is 256. Anytime you create a variable to hold an integer and the value is in this range (-5 to 256 inclusive) no new object is created. Rather your variable is assigned to the right number from the range to avoid creating entirely new integer objects every single time.

Let's play around for some time to understand things better. You can try this with `doctest`

```
>>> a = -5
>>> b = -5
>>> a is b
True # Alright! `a` and `b` point to the same object referenced from the range
>>> a = -6
>>> b = -6
>>> a is b
False # So it turns out new objects were defined for these two variable
>>> a = 140
>>> b = 140
>>> a is b
True # No new object is created here for the two variables
...
>>> a = 256
>>> b = 256
>>> a is b
True # We're still in the range so `a` and `b` reference the object already defined
>>> a = 266 # Um... `a` is lost now... where do we get an object for it? A new one has to be generated!
>>> a = 266
>>> a is b
False # You'll learn quickly that these two variables now have different objects they reference
```
To really understand everything from the interactive snippets, you can add `id(a)` and `id(b)` after each `a is b` statement.

Alright... now we're making some sense and I can see the smile forming on your face. So now lets answer the question... why 262?

Here's why, CPython would allocate objects for all the numbers from the range -5 (inclusive) all the way to 262 (also inclusive as mentioned ealier). 5 objects are defined for the first 5 negative numbers and 256 objects are also defined for the first 262 positive numbers totalling 261.

Here's the breakdown:
-5 to -1: 5 integer objects are defined [NSMALLNEGINTS](https://www.google.com/search?q=NSMALLNEGINTS)
1 to 256: 256 integer objects are defined [NSMALLPOSINTS](https://www.google.com/search?q=NSMALLPOSINTS)

5 + 256 = 261.... wait a second ğŸ¤” where's the remaining numebr coming from? That's for you to figure out! Use the following interactive snippet to validate your answer:
```
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1
>>> a is b
True
>>> id(a)
9788768
>>> id(b)
9788768
>>> a = 0
>>> b = 0
>>> a is b
True
>>> id(a)
9788767
>>> id(b)
9788767
```
Thank you!
