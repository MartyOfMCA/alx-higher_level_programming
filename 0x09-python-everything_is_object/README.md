# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
This directory contains source code files and scripts (bash and Python scripts) on Python objects. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Classes
* Objects & Values
* Aliasing
* Immutable vs Mutable objects
* In-built collections
  * List (cloning among other operations)
  * Set
  * Dictionary
  * Tuple

## How to run
Python script files contains the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain `#!/usr/bin/bash` followed by any of these:
* `python3 $PYFILE` where `$PYFILE` is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
* `python3 $PYCODE` where `$PYCODE` is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted

## Answer Files
There are additional `.txt` files in this directory that stores answers to some questions in plain text
