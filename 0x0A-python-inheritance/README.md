# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance
This directory contains source code files and scripts (bash and Python scripts) on Python objetcs. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Inheritance
  * Single
  * Multiple
* Overriding virtual methods
* Magic Methods

## How to run
Python script files contains the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain `#!/usr/bin/bash` followed by any of these:
* `python3 $PYFILE` where `$PYFILE` is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
* `python3 $PYCODE` where `$PYCODE` is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted

## Answer Files
There are additional `.txt` files in this directory that stores answers to some questions in plain text
