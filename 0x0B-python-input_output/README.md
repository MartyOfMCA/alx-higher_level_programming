# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
This directory cotains source code file and scripts (bash and Python scripts) on Python objects. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* File IO
* Try / Except / Finally
* Predefined Clean-up Actions using Context Managers
* JSON Encoding & Decoding

## How to run
Python script files contains the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain `#!/usr/bin/bash` followed by any of these:
* `python3 $PYFILE` where `$PYFILE` is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
* `python3 $PYCODE` where `$PYCODE` is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted

## Answer Files
There are additional `.txt` files in this directory that stores project related file like test files.
