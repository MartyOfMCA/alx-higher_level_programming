# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
This directory contains source code file and scripts (bash and Python scripts) on Almost a circle, a project that reviews everything in this repository so far. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attributes
* Getter / Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read / Write file
* args and kwargs
* Serialization / Deserialization
* JSON

## How to run
Python script files contains the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain `#!/usr/bin/bash` followed by any of these:
* `python3 $PYFILE` where `$PYFILE` is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
* `python3 $PYCODE` where `$PYCODE` is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted

## Test Files
There are additional `.py` files in this directory that stores the test cases or examples to be executed by `unittest`
