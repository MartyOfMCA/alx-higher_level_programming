# 0x0E. SQL - More queries
This directory contains SQL scripts on some advanced SQL concepts. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Users & Permissions
* Consistency in ACID using Constraints
* Subqueries
* Joins & Union
* The distinct clause
* Keys and relationships

## Prequisites
To run scripts in this project you need to install:
* MySQL Server 8.0.25 (or newer) [Download](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

## How To's
### Executing scripts
The script file can be given to the mysql command-line interface which in turn executes the script providing the results to the console.

`cat script.sql | mysql -h host -u database_user`
