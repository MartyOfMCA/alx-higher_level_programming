# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping
This directory contains JavaScript scipts on web scrapping using the request module and fetch API. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* JSON
* Request module
* Fetch API
* Modern JS

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can therefore be run using the syntax:

`./script`

Arguments can be passed to the script (in situations where the script accepts an argument(s)) with this syntax:

`./script argument_1 argument_2 ...`

Code description in each source code would help you determine whether any script accepts arguments
