# 0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery
This directory contains scripts on jQuery. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* jQuery
* AJAX

## How to run
All scripts used in this directory are JavaScript files. You can execute these scripts by adding the following line to the `<body>` element  in your HTML document right before the closing `</body>` element:

```
<body>
	...
	<script src="script.js"</script>
</body>
```

Replace `script.js` with any of the script you wish to run.
